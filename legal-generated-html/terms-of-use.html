<li>Email address: <a href="mailto:hello@zapal.design">hello@zapal.design</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These Terms and Conditions are binding for anyone accessing or using our websites, products and services (“User”, “you”, “your”). By accessing or using our websites, products and services (collectively referred to as “Zapal’ Products &amp; Services”), you acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, as well as by our Cookies Policy and, where applicable, by our Privacy Policy and by our Data Processing Addendum. Please, note that the applicable Cookies Policy, Privacy Policy and Data Processing Addendum will depend on the Zapal’ Products &amp; Services that you are accessing or using.</p>
<p>Additionally, depending on the Zapal’ Products &amp; Services that you are accessing and using, certain particular conditions may apply. In such a case, the applicable particular conditions will be informed to you at the time of your subscription. In the event of conflict between these general Terms and Conditions and the particular conditions applicable to the specific Zapal’ Products &amp; Services you are accessing and using, the latter shall prevail.</p>
<p>In case Zapal and the User have agreed different terms on a separate document (such as purchase order), the terms of that separate agreement will prevail in the event of conflict with these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<h2 id="1-cloud-and-on-premise-zapal-products--services">1. CLOUD AND ON-PREMISE ZAPAL' PRODUCTS &amp; SERVICES</h2>
<p>1.1 - We may offer Zapal’ Products &amp; Services both on a cloud and on an on-premise basis.</p>
<p>1.2 - These Terms and Conditions apply to both our cloud and our on-premise Zapal’ Products &amp; Services. However, please note that on-premise Zapal’ Products &amp; Services may be subject to particular terms and conditions. In that case, any particular terms and conditions will be informed to you and/or separately agreed with you at the time of your subscription. Said particular terms and conditions will prevail in the event of conflict with these general Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>1.3 - Additionally, please note that Zapal’ Products &amp; Services may be built on open-source software (as further explained in Section 6) which may be freely accessible in one or more open-source repositories. On top of that open-source software, we have developed Zapal’ Products &amp; Services, which allow us to provide our Users with extra functionalities and services.</p>
<h2 id="2-types-of-users">2. TYPES OF USERS</h2>
<p>2.1 - Users of Zapal’ Products &amp; Services can be classified into different categories, depending on their role. You can find a broad description of the main roles and their major permissions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Customer”: the Customer is a User that has acquired a free or a paid subscription to Zapal’ Products &amp; Services. The Customer is responsible for adding End Users to its different workspaces (for now Penpot teams) and for appointing Administrators for each of its workspaces. The Customer can be either a natural or a legal person, provided that they are acting in their professional capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“End User”: the End User is a User that has been added to a Customer’s workspace or a specific project (for instance, when your employer subscribes to Zapal’ Products &amp; Services and adds you to a workspace, your employer will be, for the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, the Customer, while you will be an End User). As an End User, you acknowledge that you may be removed from a workspace or project by your Customer and/or by an Administrator. If you are removed from a project, you will no longer have access to it or to any of its content, including content that may have been uploaded by you (except in the event the project is a public project, in which case you may have access to certain information of the project).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Administrator”: an Administrator is an End User that has been appointed by the Customer as having admin rights to a specific workspace.</p>
<p>2.2 - Additionally, please note that each of the main roles described above may have small variations. By way of example, the Customer of a paid subscription may be referred to (for instance, on the dashboard of our tools and on our websites) also as an “Organization Owner”.</p>
<p>2.3 - For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, Customers, End Users and Administrators are collectively referred to as Users.</p>
</li>

<p>3.8 - If you become aware or suspect that a third party may be accessing your User account, you must promptly notify Zapal by sending an email to privacy@zapal.design Please, note that even if you had advised Zapal of an unauthorized use of your User account, Zapal shall not be liable for any loss, damages, liability, expenses or attorneys’ fees arising out of or in connection with a third-party access or use of your User account.</p>
<p>3.9 - You represent that, when registering a User account, you will provide truthful and up to date information and that you will not use a false identity or the identity of a third party. 3.10 - Fair use policy means not more data usage than 10x of the median.

<h2 id="4-intellectual-property">4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
<p>4.1 GENERAL RULES</p>
<p>At Zapal, we are aware of the importance of the open-source movement, and we firmly believe in the advantages it offers to the whole Internet and programming community. For that reason, most of the modules of Zapal’ Products &amp; Services are offered under an open-source license. However, please, note that certain modules of Zapal’ Products &amp; Services are proprietary, and we offer them under our own license.</p>
<p>4.2 Zapal’ Intellectual Property Rights</p>
<p>Zapal’ Products &amp; Services open-source modules are licensed under open-source licenses (such as Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0) and other licenses endorsed by the Open-Source Initiative). Please, note that, when accessing and using our open-source modules you must comply with the terms of the corresponding open-source license.</p>
<p>4.3 User content</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You (or the Customer in which projects you are working) will remain the sole owner of the content you upload to Zapal’ Products &amp; Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, you grant Zapal (and all its authorized service providers) a worldwide, non-exclusive and non-transferable (except in the context of Zapal’ business sale or transfer) license to host, copy, access, process and transmit the content you upload to Zapal’ Products &amp; Services in order for Zapal to be able to: (i) provide you with the services and functionalities of Zapal’ Products &amp; Services; (ii) improve Zapal’ Products &amp; Services, including for analyzing metadata related to the User’s dashboard and generating statistics that allow Zapal to make Users recommendations on how to make the most of Zapal’ Products &amp; Services and improve their working efficiency. For the sake of clarity, we will only analyze metadata (such as the length of a task title, the number of Users assigned to a task, the size of the attachments, etc.), but we will not analyze the text and contents themselves (such as the name of the task title, the name of the Users assigned to a task, the content of an attachment, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You warrant that you have all rights and authorizations necessary to use any and all content that you upload to Zapal’ Products &amp; Services, and, in particular, any third-party personal data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are solely responsible and agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Zapal harmless (and its affiliates, employees, officers and directors) for any claim that the content or data uploaded to Zapal’ Products &amp; Services by you infringes third-party rights or any applicable law, or that has, for any other reason, caused injury to Zapal or any other third party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you provide any feedback (including any ideas and suggestion) to Zapal, you agree that Zapal will be free to use, disclose, reproduce, modify, sublicense, transfer, distribute and exploit said feedback in any manner and without compensating you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zapal does not pre-screen the content (including any data or feedback) uploaded by Users. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Zapal has the right (but not the obligation) to remove, in its sole discretion, any content that Zapal reasonably believes breaches this Terms and Conditions, any applicable law or any third-party rights.</p>
<p>4.4 Other Users’ Content</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you access other Users’ public projects, you agree to contribute to said public projects in good faith, which means that you shall refrain from accessing public projects with the sole purposes of boycotting them, making them useless or damaging them in any way.</p>
<p>4.5 Fonts Licensing and Usage</p>
<p>By uploading third party-owned fonts from your local machine to Penpot you understand that you will direct and cause Penpot to store such fonts on its servers. Penpot also allows you to activate font providers that might call to third party-owned web fonts which are hosted on such third parties’ services. In either case, you will be able to share these fonts with other users with whom you are collaborating on a team. It is ultimately your sole responsibility to ensure that you or your organization possess sufficient rights to use, store on Penpot, and redistribute the fonts for use by your team members, and all users with whom you share the content stored at Penpot. Bear in mind that some of these uses may require you to get extended rights from the font licensor. Before uploading a font to Penpot or using a font from a third-party font provider, it is recommended that you consult the font licensor’s license agreement. Penpot holds the right to restrict or remove the use or storage of fonts that could bring any type of licensing conflicts. You can learn more about licensing and usage of third party-owned fonts at <a href="https://www.typography.com/faq">https://www.typography.com/faq</a></p>
