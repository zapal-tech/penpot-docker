<p>Taking into account the information provided in this Cookies Policy, below we explain how you can manage the cookies used on the Web via the different options of the most common browsers (Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera). The &quot;Help&quot; functionality of most browsers tells you how to configure your browser to not accept cookies, to notify you whenever you receive a new cookie and to completely disable all cookies.</p>
<p>You can also disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as &quot;Flash Cookies&quot;, by changing the settings of these add-ons. For more information, visit the websites of the add-on manufacturers.</p>

<p>The opt-out mechanism creates a cookie that allows us to remember that you don't want additional cookies. However, if you delete your cookies after opting out, you will have to opt out again.</p>
<p>These changes only apply to the browser via which you are currently connected. To delete cookies in other devices, you must follow the process described in those devices.</p>
